# Elective-Allotment
A web application in C# which can be used by students and faculty to help in registration of elective subjects.

Each student can register using his/her registration number and program details.
Based on the program he is from, he will be allowed to choose from a list of electives, three electives that he wants to take up.
Once everyone is registered, the application can sort the registrations based on GPA and allot proper electives to the students, making the faculty's job easier.
